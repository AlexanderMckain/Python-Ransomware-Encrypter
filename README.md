# Python-Ransomware-Encrypter
This is for testing and educational purposes <b>only</b> 
<p> This is a simple python script that encrypts files listed in the directory excluding itself and the decrypter. Once deployed a key will be generated that only the Decrypter.py can decrypt. The user will also need to put in the right password for the files to be decrypted. The default password is "password123" (clever I know). There is also a simple GUI that is just text prompt at the moment.
